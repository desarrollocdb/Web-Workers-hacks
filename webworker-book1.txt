Appx. 
A. Restrictions with Local Access

Due to Google Chromeâ€™s security restrictions, workers will not run locally (e.g. from file://) in the latest versions of the browser. Instead, they fail silently! To run your app from the file:// scheme, run Chrome with the --allow-file-access-from-files flag set. It is not recommended to run your primary browser with this flag set. It should only be used for testing purposes and not regular browsing.

B. Same Origin Considerations
Worker scripts must be external files with the same scheme as their calling page. Thus, you cannot load a script from a data: URL or javascript: URL, and an https: page cannot start worker scripts that begin with http: URLs
