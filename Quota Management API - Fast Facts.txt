Quota Management API : Fast Facts

The API is described in WebIDL here: https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/group/chromium-html5/msg/5261d24266ba4366?pli=1 
On HTML5 storage, there’s a notion of TEMPORARY storage and PERSISTENT storage.
For TEMPORARY storage, it is shared between all applications and websites run in the browser.
TEMPORARY storage has a default quota of 50% of available disk. (50GB => 25GB)  [To be more specific, TEMP quota is calucalated by (remaining disk space + TEMP storage space) * 50%.  Therefore if apps are using 25GB TEMP storage in total and the current remaining disk space is 25GB that’s already full.
Each application has a limitation to have 20% of available TEMPORARY storage quota. (not restricted to 1GB anymore)
When TEMPORARY storage quota is exceeded, all the data (incl. AppCache, IndexedDB, WebSQL, File System API) stored for oldest used origin gets deleted.
When app’s TEMPORARY storage quota (20% of pool) is exceeded, an error will be thrown.
Requesting quota against TEMPORARY storage doesn’t do anything.
Requesting quota for TEMPORARY storage using requestFileSystem doesn’t actually allocate / change quota.
For PERSISTENT storage, it is only allocated for File System API when explicitly requested by requestQuota of Quota API.
This allocation is only for File System API and there’s no such thing like PERSISTENT storage on IndexedDB, WebSQL DB or AppCache.
unlimitedStorage on manifest.json of Chrome Web App has been brought as a temporary solution for apps to work without Quota API. So, there’s no guarantee that Chrome will support this feature forever.





when done.....
